              Eighteen Austin-area volunteers made the trip to Houston for an inspiring and educational regional conference. The event began on Friday night with a screening of "Age of Consequences" with panel discussion. There was discussion of what the military is doing to move away from fossil fuels, but Lt. General (Ret.) John Castellaw made sure CCL volunteers knew that ultimately "You are the power in the room tonight."

              The official conference was on Saturday at the University of Houston. It began with an opening address by Texas State Climatologist Dr. John Nielsen-Gammon on just how extraordinary a storm Harvey was. CCL's own VP of Programs Madeleine Para then presented on 2018 goals for CCL, focusing especially on the likelihood that a carbon fee and dividend bill gets introduced this year. At the lunchtime keynote Climate Leadership Council's senior VP, Greg Bertelsen, described the momentum he's observing with corporations endorsing carbon fee and dividend (he says expect an announcement in the coming months on new endorsements). He also described the the excellent reputation and effectiveness of CCL's respect-based approach that he observes in Washington D.C.
              </p>
              <p>The day also included several educational workshops, and a "State of the Region" address by outgoing 3rd Coast Regional Coordinator Brett Cease (he will be switching to a role as CCL Director of Education & Engagement), in which he celebrated the tremendous growth and accomplishments of the chapters. Finally, Susan Adams, our new Regional Coordinator closed us out with an optimistic look torward our region's future accomplishments.

              Congressional candidate Kathi Thomas visited the CCL-Austin West/Central chapter meeting to discuss climate change and her proposed agenda. Candidates West Hansen and Julie Oliver will be attending the February meeting, and we will be inviting the incumbent candidate, Rep. Williams, to join us at a future meeting. The Barton Springs chapter is also meeting with the field of candidates running to replace retiring Rep. Smith in District 21.
